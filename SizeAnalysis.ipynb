The histogram plot is not a great representation of a bell curve, where it seems there may be more past 500 that were missed because of the constraints. Based on the standard deviation, I would add and subtract 2 standard deviations (135) from the mean area, because this is about 95% of the values in the distribution. So I would change the range of particle sizes to around 245 - 515 pixels squared."
